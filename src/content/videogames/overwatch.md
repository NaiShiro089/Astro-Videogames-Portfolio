**The ultimate battleground is yours to conquer in Season 16: Stadium.**

Welcome to Stadium, our new permanent game mode! In this best-of-7, round-based mode, you’ll earn Stadium Cash to unlock powerful, game-changing abilities. You can even choose between first-person and third-person perspective to see your powers in action, and unlock rewards as you rise through the ranks.

Our new Damage Hero, Freja, is finally here. As a relentless bounty hunter, Freja thrives on mobility, precision, and calculated aggression. Her Revdraw Crossbow delivers powerful rapid-fire shots, while her Bola Shot Ultimate pulls enemies together for high-impact team plays.

Unleash your inner magical girl with DokiWatch! Join the fight against Woe with the dazzling Heroes of Heart, their leader, Mythic Heart of Hope Juno, and Mercy’s new Merciful Magitech Mythic Weapon Skin arriving later this Season.

Hop into Competitive Play to try out the new hero ban system, unlock brand new Battle Pass and Shop skins, enjoy the return of Overwatch Classic, and SO much more!

Overwatch 2 is free to play for everyone on console & PC!
